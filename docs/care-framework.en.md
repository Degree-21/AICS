# CARE Framework for Specifications

Overview
- CARE maps key specification components to AI-friendly execution

Components
- C — Context: background, purpose, assumptions
- A — Action: functional requirements and few-shot examples
- R — Result: outputs and acceptance criteria (testable)
- E — Evaluation: non-functional requirements and constraints

Usage
- Ensure every spec includes all CARE components
- Keep examples concrete and acceptance criteria measurable
- Non-functional requirements must be explicit (security, performance, reliability)

Checklist
- [ ] Context captured
- [ ] Functional requirements defined
- [ ] Edge cases listed
- [ ] Examples included
- [ ] Acceptance criteria measurable
- [ ] Non-functional requirements explicit
